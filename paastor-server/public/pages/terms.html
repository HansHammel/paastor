    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>v0.1.2<br>
    <h4>Brief</h4>
    <p>This service - referred to as "Paastor" and "Sheep" and "We" and "we" and "web site" and "web service" - is offered without warranty. "Users" | and "you" and "your" refers to a paid or unpaid customer of the service. Paastor is operated by Symbolic Logic.</p>
    <blockquote>
      Paastor is currently in paid beta. Beta software is in testing and not fully security-hardened. Users knowingly assume all risk to their businesses, servers, websites,
      systems, and applications.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to update these terms in the future with no warning and they will take effect
      immediately. For large changes we may notify users via email but it is their resonsibility 
      to check back often.
    </p>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to refuse service and cancel accounts. You retain and reserve the rights
      to your server and may cancel the service at any time by contacting hello@paastor.com.
    </p>
    <h4>Removal of Software</h4>
    <p>
      At any
      time you are free to remove the Paastor software from your server. We do not prevent you 
      from managing your server.
    </p>
    <P>At any time you may disable Paastor's connection to your server (A.K.A. Sheep instance) by removing the secret from the /root/system.json file (we highly recommend backuping up the file first). This will prevent Paastor from being able to communicate with your server.</P>
    <h4>Security</h4>
    <p>
      Paastor is not a security system server management system. It is strictly for deployment. You are
      required to apply patches and keep up to date with all software on your server - including updates to Sheep.
      Each user is responsible for their server. Paastor is a beta service which can help users deploy 
      Node.js applications faster than they may have been able to do before.
      Efforts are made to ensure security and safety, but the onus of responsibility for security falls upon the user.
    </p>
    <h4>Multiple Accounts Prohibited</h4>
    <p>
      Each person or organization is allowed one account. Violations of this may result in immediate
      account termination.
