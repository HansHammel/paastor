    h1 Terms of Service
    | v0.1.2
    br
    h4 Brief
    p This service - referred to as "Paastor" and "Sheep" and "We" and "we" and "web site" and "web service" - is offered without warranty. "Users" | and "you" and "your" refers to a paid or unpaid customer of the service. Paastor is operated by Symbolic Logic.
    blockquote Paastor is currently in paid beta. Beta software is in testing and not fully security-hardened. Users knowingly assume all risk to their businesses, servers, websites,
        | systems, and applications.

    p We reserve the right to update these terms in the future with no warning and they will take effect
        | immediately. For large changes we may notify users via email but it is their resonsibility 
        | to check back often.
    
    p We reserve the right to refuse service and cancel accounts. You retain and reserve the rights
        | to your server and may cancel the service at any time by contacting hello@paastor.com.
    
    h4 Removal of Software
    p At any
        | time you are free to remove the Paastor software from your server. We do not prevent you 
        | from managing your server.
    
    P At any time you may disable Paastor's connection to your server (A.K.A. Sheep instance) by removing the secret from the /root/system.json file (we highly recommend backuping up the file first). This will prevent Paastor from being able to communicate with your server.
    
    h4 Security
    p Paastor is not a security system server management system. It is strictly for deployment. You are
        | required to apply patches and keep up to date with all software on your server - including updates to Sheep.
        | Each user is responsible for their server. Paastor is a beta service which can help users deploy 
        | Node.js applications faster than they may have been able to do before.
        | Efforts are made to ensure security and safety, but the onus of responsibility for security falls upon the user.
    
    h4 Multiple Accounts Prohibited
    p Each person or organization is allowed one account. Violations of this may result in immediate
        | account termination.
